I am a computational physicist. Currently I am holding a Postdoc position in the Center for Data Analytics lab, headed by Prof. Dr. Ivan Dokmanic'. 

I received a Ph.D. at the Oden Institute, University of Texas at Austin in 2020. My Ph.D. adviser is Prof. Richard Tsai. 
The doctoral thesis is developing parallel-in-time methods to simulate high-frequency wave propagation. 
I received a Bachelor in Physics at the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities. 

My research interests include numerical wave propagation, multiscale modeling, deep learning, numerical analysis and linear algebra.
