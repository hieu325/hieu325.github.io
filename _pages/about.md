I am an HPC Applications engineer at ASML Netherlands. 
My previous position was at University of Basel, where the research focused on scientific machine learning applications to wave-based inverse problems.

I received a Ph.D. at the Oden Institute, University of Texas at Austin in 2020. My Ph.D. adviser is <a href="https://tsairesearch.github.io/">  Prof. Richard Tsai </a>. 
The doctoral thesis is developing parallel-in-time methods to simulate high-frequency wave propagation. 
I received a Bachelor in Physics at the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities. 

My research interests include numerical wave propagation, deep learning and scientific computing.
